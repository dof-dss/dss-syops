# Security Operating Procedures

## Introduction

Digital Shared Services (DSS) uses the NCSC's guidance document [Secure development and deployment][1]
to understand the security risks of modern code development and to establish working practices or Security
Operating Procedures (SyOPS) to mitigate against these risks.

This document details the SyOPS DSS has put in place to be compliant with each of NCSC's eight principles
of secure development and deployment:

1. [Secure development is everyone's concern](#1-secure-development-is-everyone-39-s-concern)
2. [Keep your security knowledge sharp](#2-keep-your-security-knowledge-sharp)
3. Produce clean and maintainable code
4. Secure your development environment
5. Protect your code repository
6. Secure the build and deployment pipleline
7. Continually test your security
8. Plan for security flaws

You should read this document alongside the NCSC guidance.

The intended audience for this document is:

- DSS development staff who use it as a reference guide to protecting customer's data
- DSS customers who will use it to gauge our security maturity
