# Security Operating Procedures

## Introduction

Digital Shared Services (DSS) uses the NCSC's guidance document [Secure development and deployment][1]
to understand the security risks of modern code development and to establish working practices or Security
Operating Procedures (SyOPS) to mitigate against these risks.

This document details the SyOPS DSS has put in place to be compliant with each of NCSC's eight principles
of secure development and deployment:

1. [Secure development is everyone's concern](#1-secure-development-is-everyone-39-s-concern)
2. [Keep your security knowledge sharp](#2-keep-your-security-knowledge-sharp)
3. [Produce clean and maintainable code](#3-produce-clean-and-maintainable-code)
4. [Secure your development environment](#4-secure-your-development-environment)
5. [Protect your code repository](#5-protect-your-code-repository)
6. [Secure the build and deployment pipleline](#6-secure-the-build-and-deployment-pipeline)
7. [Continually test your security](#7-continually-test-your-security)
8. [Plan for security flaws](#8-plan-for-security-flaws)

You should read this document alongside the NCSC guidance.

The intended audience for this document is:

- DSS development staff who use it as a reference guide to protecting customer's data
- DSS customers who will use it to gauge our security maturity

## Incident Reporting

In order to minimise the damage from security incidents, security weaknesses, web malfunctions and information (data) loss and to assist others in preventing the repetition of such incidents, it is vital that incidents affecting security are reported in an appropriate way and through the correct channels as quickly as possible. All staff should be made aware of this procedure for reporting different types of incident. Each type of loss should be reported to the relevant personnel as described below:

| Type of incident | Report to |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Loss or theft of laptop / PC / portable device on which data was held | Refer to [DoF Data Breach Management Plan](http://nics.intranet.nigov.net/finance/documents/dof-data-breach-management-plan)|
| Loss or thef of printed data | as above |
| Unauthorised (or inappropriate) electronic transmission/transfer of data breaching data protection | as above |
| Accidental, inappropriate or malicious deletion of electronic data by staff, contractors or delivery partners | as above |
| Loss or corruption of data due to failure of IT systems and/or manual procedures | as above |
| External hacking into departmental IT systems leading to disclosure or destruction/corruption of data | as above |
| Unauthorised (or inappropriate) access to data by staff, on-line customers, external contractors and delivery partners | as above |
| Attempted hacking e.g. unknown USB device in PC | Line manager, IT Assist, ITSO |
| Sharing of single sign-on passwords | Line manager, ITSO |
| Requests for staff to disclose their password | as above |
| Virus or malicious software | IT Assist |
