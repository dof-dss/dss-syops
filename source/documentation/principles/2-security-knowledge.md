### 2. Keep your security knowledge sharp

During induction new team members are made aware of their responsibility to comply with NICS security policies through mandatory training and reading.

Team members must complete our Security Fundamentals training programme before being allowed access to developer tools and environments. Further training and experience is required before staff can be granted access to production environments and live data.

#### Security Fundamentals

- Cyber Security (e-Learning)

- Government Security Classifications (e-Learning)

- Managing Information Effectively (e-Learning)

- [A Guide to Physical, Document and IT Security](http://nics.intranet.nigov.net/nics/documents/guide-physical-document-and-it-security)<sup>[NICS Intranet link]</sup>

- [NICS Mobile Device Security Policy](http://nics.intranet.nigov.net/nics/documents/nics-mobile-device-security-policy)<sup>[NICS Intranet link]</sup>

Having completed Security Fundamentals, Junior Developers will work in a sandboxed environment where they will learn about design patterns, code quality and security. They will learn through pair programming, code reviews by more senior colleagues and through formal training.

Developers who have completed basic training will be encouraged to develop their security knowledge through online training, classroom based training, networking with other developers and attending events and conferences.
