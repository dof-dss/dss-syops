### 3. Produce clean and maintainable code

We develop .Net web applications using the [MVC design pattern](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc) with Unit of Work and the Repository Pattern for data access.

There are many reasons for using these standards and patterns but for the purposes of this document the benefit is that they make our code more testable and therefore more secure.

Developers must adhere to the following guidance:

- Before code is written in must be specified and passed as *ready* by the development team and the customer

- Submit no more than 100 lines of code at a time

- Store code in a version control system where you will be attributed as the author

- Before submitting code for review run the following checks:

  - todo: checklist for submitting code for review
  - todo: checklist for merge requests

- Ensure all code is review by a senior or lead developer

- Do not review and approve your own code

- Do not promote your own code to production
