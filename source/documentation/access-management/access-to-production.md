### Access to and use of live (production) data

Access to and use of production will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. Access to production data
must be approved by the Information Asset Owner. Permissions are only active for the day in which they were
given and will be automatically removed at the end of each night. There are occasions whereby staff may
require a longer period of elevated privileges dependent on work responsibilities. In such circumstances the
standard process should be used outlining the justification for such and the time frame needed. Access will be
removed at the end of each given time period.

As a general rule, production data **must not** be used for testing and development purposes. Where a clean and
justifiable need to use production data has been identified then the following guidelines must be followed:

- all sensitive details and content should be removed or modified beyond recognition (anonymised)
- access control procedures should be the same as those applied to production data
- there must be separate authorisation each time production data is being copied
- production data should be erased from a test environment immediately after testing is complete
- the copying and use of production data must be logged to provide an audit trail
