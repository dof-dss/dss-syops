## Access Management

Formal user registration and de-registration procedures must be used to grant and revoke access to all
information systems and services including applications, database systems and server environments. In
each case an IT Assist Service Desk reference should be generated.

The principle of **least privilege** should be used when granting access to systems and services. Staff
should only be able to access the information and resources that are necessary for their legitimate purpose.
This principle is widely recognised as a key control in minimising the risk of malicious and accidental
damage to information assets.

Staff must acquire an administrative account from which to perform their administrative/development duties. These
accounts are created by IT Assist after a request has been made by a user's line manager (minimum ICT L5) and
approved by the departmental ITSO. Line managers must seek assurance that each new member of staff has the
Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) as minimum before such a request is made. A standard user account
should never be used to perform any administrative/development duties.

Access to **all** permissions groups must be administered throughout the standard internal IT Assist process and
must be signed off at ICT L5 or above.

Changes in job roles should be matched with the relevant changes in permissions groups. Under no circumstances
should staff attempt to elevate their privileges or the privileges of any other staff member. Similarly they
should never attempt to gain access to areas of work for which they have not been given specific approval or
to provide access to others.

On leaving the department all access (including administrative rights) should be disabled at the end of the
employees last day. It is the responsibility of the line manager to ensure this is completed successfully.
Disabled accounts will be deleted by IT Assist after an agreed length of time.

Only authorised users may access the source code of systems. Segregation of duties, technical access controls
and robust procedures must be employed whenever amendments to software are necessary. Only authorised users
may deploy software on operational systems.
