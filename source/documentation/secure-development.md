### 1. Secure development is everyone's concern

We make security everyone's concern by embedding security throughout the development process.

#### How we embed security throughout the development lifecycle

- We keep our security knowledge sharp (see [Principle 2](#2-keep-your-security-knowledge-sharp))

- We insist on customers completing a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before a project can start. This allows us to understand the risks associated with the data we will be processing.

- During *Discovery* and *Alpha* phases Lead Developers will design the system with a focus on security. This reduces the risk of inexperienced developers exposing security vulnerabilities through poor architecture decisions.

- We document customer requirements in user story format. All user stories must pass our *Definition of Ready (DoR)* before they can be considered for development. Included in our DoR is a security check where we ask the question "Does this pose a security risk?". Our user stories include a mandatory notes section on security. This forces business analysts, developers, testers and customers to consider security when defining, designing, developing and testing a new feature.

The majority of applications we build get independently security tested by CHECK qualified security consultants. We share the results of the security test with the whole team as soon as these are known. This ensures that everyone, not just those directly involved in the project, is made aware of any new security risks and how to mitigate them.
